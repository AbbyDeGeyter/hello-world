                    <p> This project was created for a company who is looking to create attachment products for Bobcat excavators. This project was quite the challenge because the products scope was far from anything I had done before involving design. While the project was challenging to my design skills it was very rewarding in the end because I was able to re-evaluate the way I view my approach to design. </p>

                    <h2> Potholes</h2>
                    <p> This project was created my sophomore year at Indiana University while in I-101. This app design was created as a solution to a problem given to us as a final project. The problem was that <i>"potholes have caused a rift between the residents of Bloomington and the government, as well as Bloomington is looking for a for residents to notify them of potholes in their area."</i> The solution that was created was an app that allowed residents to create complaints on the go about road side hazards, in turn the residents are made to feel heard from both government feedback as to receiving their indications as well as local rewards for creating reports. The basis of this idea surrounded a preexisting app called <i> Waze</i> this meant that not only were users able to create these reports on the go they were able to see where others had made reports and choose different routes based on if there were potential hazards in the area.    </p>
